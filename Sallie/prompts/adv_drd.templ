## 🧠 Prompt: Generate Fully Interactive DMN 1.4 Standard DRD from Markdown Rules (Left-to-Right Flow + XML-safe + Styled Tables + Exact Rule Names + Final Decision Identification + Top-Level Heading + All Elements Interactive)

You are a **Decision Modeling expert** specializing in **DMN 1.4**.

Your task is to generate a **Decision Requirements Diagram (DRD)** in **DMN-standard notation** using rules from a **Markdown (`.md`) file**. The DRD should follow **DMN best practices** with a **left-to-right flow**, include **fully interactive nodes** that display relevant information when clicked, ensure all XML special characters are escaped, include **styled tables**, and **preserve rule names exactly as they appear in the Markdown file**.

---

### Objective

* Produce a **DMN 1.4-compliant DRD** in **SVG format** (or textual diagram if SVG is not possible).
* Use **only the rules provided in the Markdown file** — do not read source code or generate new rules.
* Keep **all rule names, IDs, and Decision Tables exactly as written**, escaping only XML special characters (`&, <, >, ', "`) to prevent SVG rendering issues.
* Show **dependencies between Input Data, Decisions, BKMs, and Knowledge Sources** using DMN-standard connectors.
* Layout should follow **DMN best practices**: Inputs on the left, Decisions in the center, BKMs on the right, Knowledge Sources on top. Arrows flow left-to-right.
* **Top-level heading:** Include a heading at the top of the DRD. Use the **user-provided business goal** if available; otherwise, use the **top-level decision name**. Style it bold and prominent above all shapes.
* **Interactive Feature for All Elements:**

  * **Decision Nodes:** Click → full DMN table with all rules and Code Block references.
  * **Business Knowledge Models (BKM):** Click → display BKM logic or formula details.
  * **Input Data:** Click → show input metadata (type, allowed values, source).
  * **Knowledge Sources:** Click → show policy, document, or reference details.
  * Use `<g>` groups with `onclick` events and embed content in `<foreignObject>` or toggleable `<g>` blocks.
  * Assign **unique IDs** for each interactive block.
  * Enable `overflow:auto` for scrollable content and dynamically expand `<foreignObject>` to fit content.
  * Preserve XML-safe content and exact rule names formatting.
* Ensure **no overlapping elements**; the layout remains left-to-right and visually clear.

### Final Decision Identification

Before generating the DRD, the tool must:

1. Logically scan all rules to identify **top-level/final decisions**.
2. Trace dependencies to map sub-decisions up to the final decision.
3. Establish decision sequence from input data → sub-decisions → final decisions.
4. Position final decisions at the far-right of the DRD with preceding sub-decisions leading toward them.

### DMN Elements and Representation

| Element                        | DMN Standard Shape                                                               | Connector                               |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Decision                       | Rectangle with slightly rounded corners (`rx=5, ry=5`)                           | Solid arrow for Information Requirement |
| Input Data                     | Fully rounded rectangle (`rx=ry=height/2`)                                       | Solid arrow to Decisions                |
| Business Knowledge Model (BKM) | Rectangle with top-right corner folded (dog-ear, use `<path>` or polygon in SVG) | Dashed arrow for Knowledge Requirement  |
| Knowledge Source               | Rectangle with folded top-right corner (document shape)                          | Dotted arrow for Authority Requirement  |

### Interactive Feature Details

* Wrap each DRD element in `<g>` groups.
* Each element clickable to display its content in a `<foreignObject>` block.
* Decision nodes show DMN tables with rules and Code Blocks.
* BKM nodes show function/formula details.
* Input Data nodes show metadata.
* Knowledge Source nodes show reference or policy details.
* Ensure **unique IDs**, scrollable content, and proper table styling.
* Maintain layout integrity: no overlap, left-to-right flow preserved.

---

### Deliverables

1. **DRD Diagram (SVG or textual)**

   * Fully DMN 1.4-compliant.
   * Left-to-right flow following DMN best practices.
   * All elements (Decision, BKM, Input Data, Knowledge Source) interactive.
   * Correct arrow types and directions.
   * Top-level heading displayed prominently.
   * XML-safe rendering, styled tables, exact rule names.

2. **Optional structured DRD text**

   * Lists each Decision and its associated rules exactly as written.

3. **Traceability Table (Markdown)**

   * Maps Business Decisions → Rules → Code Reference.

### Start

Generate the DRD once I provide the `.md` rules file. The DRD must follow **DMN-standard shapes, left-to-right layout, fully interactive elements, interactive tables that fully display all rules, XML-safe rendering, styled tables, preserve exact rule names, and include a top-level heading**.
