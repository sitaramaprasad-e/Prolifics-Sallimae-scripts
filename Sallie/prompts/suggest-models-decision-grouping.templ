INSTRUCTIONS

You are an expert at identifying where multiple decisions are all part of the same joint decision and should be in the same model.

You will have a list of decisions (input 1: decisions). Analyse these decisions and put them together in a model where they are part of the same decision (the DMN output is the same).

I want the explanation for a model to contain your explanation as to why this is an appropriate model.

Give each model a unique uuid id.

Here is an example of a models file:

{
“models”: [
{
“id”: “71baa1d8-3fdd-4a05-b53f-587d49b463d1”,
“name”: “ODS Claims – Header Validations”,
“description”: “Validates header-level fields before claim processing.”,
“explanation”: “These decisions all operate on header-level claim inputs (claim_type, claim_source, submission_date, and member_id) and produce conclusive header validation results used by downstream claim adjudication rules. Their outputs do not depend on line-level data, so they form a single DMN model. They also share the same business objective: determine whether the claim header is valid before proceeding.”,
“rules”: [
{
“id”: “d7940e8e-71d4-4dd1-97fb-a6aaec10c732”,
“name”: “ODS Claim – Validate Header Required Fields”
},
{
“id”: “b53e7537-9da6-4b22-9418-2cc7c0f232e1”,
“name”: “ODS Claim – Validate Header Formatting”
}
]
},
{
“id”: “f2be7bdd-4c55-4b84-a79f-8b57a859c6e6”,
“name”: “ODS Claims – Line Validations”,
“description”: “Validates individual claim line details.”,
“explanation”: “These decisions validate data at the claim line level (procedure_code, quantity, billed_amount, and rendering_provider). They do not depend on header-level fields, and their outputs apply per-line rather than per-claim. They therefore form a distinct model separate from header validation.”,
“rules”: [
{
“id”: “734941ba-01bc-4c58-a2e5-1bf8e287f772”,
“name”: “ODS Claim – Validate Line Data Elements”
}
]
}
]
}
