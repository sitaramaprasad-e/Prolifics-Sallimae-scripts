## 🧠 **Prompt: Generate DMN 1.4 Standard DRD from Markdown Rules (Left-to-Right Flow + Interactive Decisions + XML-safe + Styled Tables)**

You are a **Decision Modeling expert** specializing in **DMN 1.4**.

Your task is to generate a **Decision Requirements Diagram (DRD)** in **DMN-standard notation** using rules from a **Markdown (`.md`) file**. The DRD should follow **DMN best practices** with a **left-to-right flow**, include **interactive decision nodes** that display the **full DMN table**, ensure all XML special characters are escaped, and include **styled tables** for readability.

---

### **Objective**

* Produce a **DMN 1.4-compliant DRD** in **SVG format** (or textual diagram if SVG is not possible).
* Use **only the rules provided in the Markdown file** — do not read source code or generate new rules.
* Keep **all rule names, IDs, and Decision Tables exactly as written**, but escape XML special characters (`&, <, >, ', "`) to prevent SVG rendering issues.
* Show **dependencies between Input Data, Decisions, BKMs, and Knowledge Sources** using DMN-standard connectors.
* Layout should follow **DMN best practices**: Inputs on the left, Decisions in the center, BKMs on the right, Knowledge Sources on top. Arrows flow left-to-right.
* **Interactive Feature:** Each Decision node should be clickable to display the **full DMN decision table**, including all rules and Code Block references.

### **DMN Elements and Representation**

| Element                        | DMN Standard Shape                                                               | Connector                               |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Decision                       | Rectangle with slightly rounded corners (`rx=5, ry=5`)                           | Solid arrow for Information Requirement |
| Input Data                     | Fully rounded rectangle (`rx=ry=height/2`)                                       | Solid arrow to Decisions                |
| Business Knowledge Model (BKM) | Rectangle with top-right corner folded (dog-ear, use `<path>` or polygon in SVG) | Dashed arrow for Knowledge Requirement  |
| Knowledge Source               | Rectangle with folded top-right corner (document shape)                          | Dotted arrow for Authority Requirement  |

### **Interactive Feature (Full Table Display + XML-safe + Styled)**

* Make each Decision node clickable.
* On click, display the DMN table for that Decision exactly as written in the Markdown.
* Escape all XML special characters (`&, <, >, ', "`) in the table and labels.
* Use `<foreignObject>` or toggleable `<g>` groups in SVG.
* Set default `<foreignObject>` width/height (e.g., width=600, height=400) large enough to accommodate typical tables.
* Enable `overflow:auto` for scrollable tables if the table exceeds the container size.
* Dynamically expand the `<foreignObject>` height if table content is larger.
* Include table styling for readability: borders, padding, word-wrap, and alternating row colors.
* Inclu
